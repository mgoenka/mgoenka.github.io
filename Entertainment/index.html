<div class="entry">
<p><pre>Why do stars shine I do not know,
Why do birds fly I could not crow.
Moving by my side is none I tame
A passing light in a lonely lane

Often I see the trembling tower
Reckoning me to use my power
Strength I lose feeling low;
There is the angel boosting throw

How do I present an evil dance?
Do I need to outrage the chance;
Chocolates I have highly admired
Why don't you taste them before my bier?

While I talk of things at large,
Somebody peeps in forming mirage.
How it happens, everyone wonders
People call it silly when it thunders!

Is it about the talks you undergo,
Or just the fervour to maintain flow?
Switching lanes is traditional crime;
Still the world changes with passive time.

If I could abandon the change happening
You would be the shadow breadthening.
Things mostly remain skin deep,
Still everyone desires for the big leap!

Lonesome travels to the hazy farm
Turns the reckless stone sounding alarm.
Some heed only to the strangers' say
Others wait for the brooding hybrid, May.

Every job has an objective ahead
Who cares even if it lays death-bed.
Mariners trouble with false charm
And keep claiming it does no harm.

Life is a beautiful race, peasants claim
Never do they realize what to aim;
Dark is the sky with the handsome past
Burning are the flames with the mast

In the night of dawn do I stay,
While the sun shines I betray
Not that the sky is sigh
But the stars lonely praise high

You are the storm of the horror
Afraid are the ghosts in terror
Why are the lanes so crowdy
The Marshall is animated rowdy

Seeing you gives profound pleasure
Don't know what the world treasures
Amity has never been at steep rates
Who knows why the Nightingale accelerates

While I lay firm by the lady's side
You were dreaming, you never lied
Things go straight and forward
People moan the famous coward

Is it just me, or you too
The mystery created, makes me boo
I need to know, where I stand
Or should I wait for ancient land?

It’s been hard to stop the thoughts
Quarrels I underwent with the lots
A return I have wished to your town
Earnest has been the look of frown!

<h4>&raquo; April 7, 2008</h4>
</div>

<div class="entry">
<p><pre>Neither am I sad nor am I taking sigh,
From this crazy world I am Soaring High!

Entertainment of felony, 
Fun in dismay 
A lot many wonder 
Why I am in hay? 

Tremendous was the issue, 
High was the rate; 
Fast was the soaring pace, 
While I moved to the gate. 

Crowd all around me 
I had never seen 
Nurse was a stranger 
At a place, I hadn’t been. 

How could I find a pain, 
While the sky was blue, 
Everyone took me in lap 
What’s happening was only clue. 

The passage of time, brought quarrel, 
Astounding was the response 
Somebody had been watching 
Every Mariner’s song! 

Glory is what, I had achieved! 
Why was I wandering? 
Let the world take charge, 
I was the only one pondering. 

Days passed, and heightened my pace, 
I was not in hurry 
But somebody, came from ice 
Burning and adding to my worry :( 

The sun was burning 
No wonder, I had to take chance 
The earth kept rocking 
Breaking the proceeding dance. 

Everything I thought, I had achieved 
All the available glory I had seized; 
The directed craft came to my hand. 
People wondered why I changed band. 

Fascinating crow was hooked by neck, 
My lady was the one lying pecked. 
Every step I took towards her, 
Added to the world’s coming disaster. 

Unknown to the fact I lay straight, 
Robots kept moving for my fate. 
Just a pin, I had encountered 
Was it enough? She pottered. 

This is the end, I never knew 
So close were many, left a few; 
I kept moving at the same pace 
Why was family slow, none effaced! 

That was my exit, from the world, 
You don’t cry at flowers curled! 
And to tune it, in my style 
Opened ahead was my crime file. 

Why would I suicide was strange 
How could I stand to say the pain? 
Lying was I, on the shoulders’ pier 
My murderer carried me to my bier 

Here, I lie straight and skinned, 
While she celebrates opening tin. 
Crocodiles are what she has found, 
Tears in her eyes, never rebound! 

Smiling beauty I had admired 
She would be so, never fired 
So was my life unto an end 
A quirking charm, came to a bend 

She was married, enjoying life, 
I kept wondering looking for chide. 
With time she realized the gain, 
Tied were my hands, without chain. 

Long ago, she carried a task 
Uncle Sam, lay aside in a mask 
He was the man, I looked for 
Kept hunting, with multiple chores! 

This lady was a lovely saint 
This man, good enough, made her faint 
There she lay for her admire 
Never knew, what was lightening fire! 

Heavy bomb, Sam had planted 
She as usual, drove enchanted, 
A little thinner was my pace 
Click of the button, won the race. 

Then came the turn to reflect, 
I was wondering for end perfect. 
Now in red, she smoothly lay 
Uncle took her to the coming bay. 

I was there waiting for her 
She scolding, why I murmur, 
God had taken an advance 
To make me take, another glance. 

This glance I wouldn’t forget, 
Uncle escaped the complete torment 
Did she ever love, I didn’t know 
Nor did I care for the sea flow 

This quotation that you read by, 
Took three lives, don’t know why? 
Uncle came to this clown 
Ran away leaving the town. 

Neither am I sad nor am I taking sigh,
Yet I feel like wiping your tears and cry;
From this crazy world, I have Soared Very High

<h4>Gear Up &raquo; January 17, 2008</h4>
</div>

<div class="entry">
<p>
<pre>Moving in the streets wide,
I find the glory shine,
While I lay insane,
Did the dreams make me faint?

I am dying to touch my skin,
What bothers me makes you akin.
Why at all do I wonder?
You are the one, warning the thunder.

Long are the roads I have traversed,
Away are the dreams shattered?
Sometimes the looks are high
At others do the spirits sigh

Life is what I have profound?
Early are the leaves bound,
Quarrelling and fighting I disowned,
While a lady taught, all renowned.

Your face is all the glory I renounced,
My job is just to carry forward the cherub bounced
In the crowd, was I, the only one visible to you,
Wondering why I kept caring for the shoe

Sometimes are the houses red
Sometimes is the temperature high
Look down at thy lonely feet
You are above the rowdy flight

Teachers have had their say
They have taught, come what may
That is why I wish to lie,
In the pampered bed with a tie.

Early in the morning I talk
Late in the night buddies walk,
Soaring down is the soul praised,
Pouring deep is the rain graced.

Never could I travel the lane
This exactly makes the efforts go vain.
Not necessary that I crumble,
Surely, I am learning not to tumble.

Half lit Moon and a transparent sky,
Black was the time when you were standing high,
Now, gone are the stars bright and insane,
Time for you to drive another luxury plane.

Where is the star shining brightly,
While I lie in the forbidden peace
Now, I know the story in the classic untold.
It was true, as long as I twisted the path unfold.

Things are more longing than ever.
Life here is as busy and as surprising as never.
Why will the passion within me ignite,
When gone is the situation when I was by your site.

How long will you lie in the street,
Why at all, do you find your ringing fleet,
Typical strength was the trauma I survived,
Shyness was the limit of the uncertain pride.

Love is when the streams keep chasing,
Endeavors and Glories are more than surpassed
What you gain is never counted at all
Though you are the one, making the last call

Where should I go and switch attire?
Isn’t the world is threatening to retire?
What it gains out of me, is it ever asked?
Whatever you hear, is it always laughed?

<h4>Enough ‘love’ to ‘target’ &raquo; January 21, 2006</h4>
</div>

<div class="entry">
<p>
A lovely time out,planning that night,
<br>When the ranger with me came forward
<br>We were in the lane,walking all bright,
<br>The angel in the picture forwarded no answer.
<br> 
<br>From where did the planet come in the picture.
<br>Why was ‘Saturn’ for it,not so blamed
<br>High tide was soon to come by the fixture
<br>But the arrival also,virtually planned
<br> 
<br>I was to be struck heavily by lightning,
<br>The sound was inexorably on the run
<br>Tears kept a compressive slide of flowing
<br>Decisions never paced for the easy march.
<br> 
<br>“What in the world,do I desire?”,I murmured,
<br>With none hearing what I solely plea
<br>Third in thoughts I never jostled,
<br>Glorious was the wide view about the sea
<br> 
<br>Many parks clutched together as one
<br>Similarly,spiral lives strictly constant
<br>Each separately making mine insane,
<br>And the motto every time laical patent
<br> 
<br>Your hands in mine,I had always desired
<br>Obvious question put forward by my head
<br>Agreement marching to make me fired,
<br>Story continuing even upto my deathbed.
<br> 
<br>Forgiveness in thy heart,somehow developed
<br>Good was the word excellently taken-up
<br>Fate and instances,both abruptly mixed
<br>By then,I usually forgot,how to make-up
<br> 
<br>Nights I slept cleaning properly,her laps
<br>In the morning,was the face,full of wax
<br>There had been an expectancy of her slaps
<br>However,the distances paid reversing tax
<br> 
<br>Never had the weather been so humble
<br>Very hard,I was trying for restless search
<br>Your answering so slowly made me thumble
<br>Soothing,was your so painful,solemn touch
<br> 
<br>When the day of forsaking terminally stroked,
<br>Story had complete lot embedded tight
<br>Who knows why was aloofness still inforced,
<br>She knew the decisions,I managed to sight
<br> 
<br>Cursive was what blocked frequent writings
<br>Life-history to be opened in the heavy fine,
<br>Dresser merrily working on my wings,
<br>Another ‘Pamelion’,I wasn’t going to tame.
<br> 
<br>This was the era that took long time
<br>In the depths of sand,I mismanaged rhyme
<br>You were there following all my line
<br>Whether melancholy or loving lengthy signs.
<br>Loving you was unanimous,I had decisioned,
<br>Being sophisticated imparted this much to learn!

<p>
I keep dreaming of you and that is all I do, 
<br>My classes go on while I get no time to bow! 
<br>It was first with Mathematics that I started, 
<br>By the time human arrived I almost farted 
<br> 
<br>I then think of another thing I shouldn’t have done, 
<br>Called your name and replied with bomb, 
<br>The lecture in Engineering Mechanics was far boring. 
<br>Thy own world was where I was soaring. 
<br> 
<br>What all should I be doing now,was my thought, 
<br>Things I had always planned made me sought, 
<br>The thought of Basic Mechanical Engineering fade my smile, 
<br>But the tremendous boiler,made way to my books pile. 
<br> 
<br>The family was always brutal for my heavy absence, 
<br>The authority never knew,this earth marked my presence 
<br>Another excursion is what Physics had larked, 
<br>Every stationary item,on my table,I had parked. 
<br> 
<br>Then my high school ‘Geography’ I was reminded, 
<br>Planets around,unofficially,made this also minded. 
<br>Basically,Civil Engineering is what I was suffering, 
<br>Someone kept answering to answers,another kept murmuring. 
<br> 
<br>Books are what I often observe in my rack, 
<br>At another venue,they made their way out of sack, 
<br>It was the turn to see my college ‘Library’, 
<br>The scene of my time-table had made me merry. 
<br> 
<br>“Full marks to you”,is what I kept hearing, 
<br>Practicals were what made me keep clearing. 
<br>It was then to ‘Basic Mechanical Engineering Lab’, 
<br>My heart had been pounding to press the ‘Tab’. 
<br> 
<br>A ‘Laboratory’ of ‘Geography’,I had never attended 
<br>Also,there was no work,I had ever pended, 
<br>But the Lab of ‘Basic Civil Engineering’ resulted work due, 
<br>What I could do,was still vigorously few. 
<br> 
<br>It was back to the world of guilty crime, 
<br>After the permanent planning,I had no time. 
<br>With a system I was prepared for CP-I, 
<br>Had I spoken the three words,I would have been ragged! 
<br> 
<br>After the boring lecture,everyone got to be gay 
<br>Black burning sun,to the engineer’s day, 
<br>‘Engineering Mechanics’ was now to be heard in the hall, 
<br>The thought of the swift arrival made me tall. 
<br> 
<br>Then the thought of gates,loaded the spirits high, 
<br>When I arrived in,I somehow managed to survive, 
<br>The turn of ‘Physics Laboratory’ made me decline, 
<br>I just couldn’t realize how I crossed the border line. 
<br> 
<br>Everything was different,the atmosphere light, 
<br>A furious face always,was forever out of sight. 
<br>‘Computer Programming’ finally,never seemed to happen, 
<br>It was the time,my broth forwarded clashing. 
<br> 
<br>There is one thing I am subjected not to speak about, 
<br>Only the doors know why,the seniors shout so loud.

<div class="entry">
<p><pre>When the eyes dry and the mind sheds tears
The heart keeps wondering, often you forget wears
When you lie down, there is darkness all around
The laugh you share and the worriness allowed

Keep looking for merriment and the time lost
Live like a ranger on a mountain making mast
Sing like a spy and you have clues all aright
Whenever you see, all the white in every rite

Astonished to see such a change, I changed game
The way you take surprises, the way I forgo the tame
Glory and fame unless together barred to compose
Name and fame capable of passing every pose.

Every time I look high, deep into the dwadling sky
You are there, I am there, presence of both only to my
Gusto and fervour, with celebrations at one spot
Why should I bat, with bats all adding dot?

I know I will enjoy, whenever stoop to dance
The joy in the engagement of every Lance
Why to sit and just gaze at the stars,
When each of them are tied in my bars.

Night when approaches makes quirking odour
All the black then lit with a single color

The book you buy to match my own smile
Looks I share at every walk through the mile
I pet, every star that shines beyond my file.

<h4>&raquo; December 19, 2003</h4>
</div>

<div class="entry">
<p><pre>What you feel, when in a crowd?
Lines of loneliness, are always aloud
Keep your feelings, thoughts at sight
The company you want all abide
Friends you long for, of one kind.

Loneliness in a bulk, how you feel?
People surround you with screams
Its hard to miss oppurtunities
Laughter all around you at ease
World of colors, when they count?

Life is long, hard to fight
Roads of card full of might
Keep driving you will win
Avoid loneliness in all streams
Highways are hard to miss, but fuss?

Often you keep running up and down
Mates you think of in each sound
What you gain? Loneliness, every lane
Keep running at the pace you can
Find the world of changed names!

Highly you esteem yourself too.
Make all the paintings of a zoo
Creatures, God have created alike
Features, each of them disguise
Loneliness, one to everyone's like.

The time you take it as you enjoy
In every mirth, everlasting joy
Thought of Shahrukh, and movies
Scene, of Tendulkar, fighting hot
Lives of Gates, always on top.

While you search for joy profound
You will find it in long noise
Silence, the beauty you appreciate
Stars, shine whatsoever be the case
Think of the life, when cry is gay.

Friends for no reason you will find
Smile, it costs everything of yours
To take away every loneliness tight,
Joy, the worst conscience at height
Grab the kite as I give away thy life.

Then turns the universe to watch
Glooming at you, whenever you park
At your rescue, the joy only lieau
Dress you put on, packed well
How to speak, my thought of hell?

Love, at first call of mine,
Thy heart I see, in every sign
How come you call it sad
The earth, as I speak goes mad
World of joy, I don't enjoy
Joy of loneliness, rememberance I sigh.

Neither I am sad,nor I am taking sigh, 
<br>But yet I feel like to cry 
<br>Perhaps,I don't know the reason,Why? 
<br>In this crazy world I am soaring high- 
<br> 
<br>The valley of green in the midst of the sea- 
<br>River of sorrow painting the scene- 
<br>The rise of dawn,or the rise of the dark 
<br>Both seem to bore 
<br>Also,paid heed to the girl,as she matured, 
<br> 
<br>With the flow in the then pace of time. 
<br>We strive,we strive,we strive. 
<br>Lack of feloly and entertainment of gay 
<br>Moulded the world to a beautiful bay. 
<br> 
<br>The environment that surrounds me, 
<br>And the sky that abounds me. 
<br>Threw a gaze of fright, 
<br>Crying and yelling not to fly. 
<br> 
<br>Land to the battle by shuttle, 
<br>Weeded the road to divide. 
<br>They had a word to say, 
<br>However,hardships were not in total dismay. 
<br> 
<br>Sound of the music rated high 
<br>The golden fleece and the beautiful Diana lay aside. 
<br>The thought of the singing stream and the whirling pool. 
<br>Reminded of the whistling girl and the swirling rule, 
<br> 
<br>Black and white even alike. 
<br>When the brown spirits rise high 
<br>Homage to a shrine and thought of a crime 
<br>Link themselves to the stars glowing and throwing a shine 
<br> 
<br>Sorrow and joy,hello and hi,flirt and enjoy! 
<br>All seem rather blue,But 
<br>In the roots of friendship,there lies no dew- 
<br>Heel the pain,note the gain and forget me not leading yourself to a CRANE. 
<br> 
<br>In a stream as narrow as the busy street, 
<br>The water of love flows,remembering the true virtue of a rose. 
<br>I say,"Remember everyone as a friend"- 
<br>She exclaims,"Just try not to remember me". 
<br> 
<br>Leaving the rage the song renounced- 
<br>A feeling of freshness gave complete bow. 
<br> 
<br>In the depths of nature,were we brought-up together, 
<br>With a reason to lament,we rolled down the swarthy trigger. 
<br>The domed structure rode ahead 
<br>While we waited for our spirits to follow 
<br>Punishment and excuses for no reason were induced! 
<br> 
<br>Its the clock whence I have left the universe behind. 
<br>Now,neither I am sad,nor I am taking sigh. 
<br>But yet I feel like to wipe your pearls and myself cry 
<br>Though,indeed I don't know the reason why 
<br>Bruised hearts and the aching eyes,shout to lie,while the days are passing by, 
<br>THE DAYS ARE PASSING BY.

Once a boy from a cell

<br>Held by instinctive circumstances 
<br>Met to decrease further grieviences 
<br> 
<br>You can see me and I see you- 
<br>Was both the view 
<br>Compare with the old age- 
<br>You will find,nothing new 
<br> 
<br>Passage of time brought up quarrel 
<br>"I thought you were from a good family",

<br>Silence was the motto of the boy,but he had enjoyed. 
<br> 
<br>Soon,the secret of love broke out 
<br>News spread with a sprout. 
<br>A bit of friendship between the two, 
<br>Words exchanged were very few. 
<br> 
<br>Then came the time of explosure, 
<br>Start was the misfortunate sticker. 
<br>To follow was a card torn down, 
<br>Which couldn’t even undertake a frown. 
<br> 
<br>Another disaster occurred on an ethetic day, 
<br>"I don’t appreciate it",was said in dismay. 
<br>He thought it to be a golden chance 
<br>But the flying chocolate broke down the proceeding dance. 
<br> 
<br>Letter issue could not turn to be tissue 
<br>He couldn’t even say,"I missed you." 
<br>Trip together was very short, 
<br>Short enough to unite the approaching heart. 
<br> 
<br>Distances created were very long 
<br>And only one day could bring them on song 
<br>If they had to die one day! 
<br>Why was it not that day or even today? 
<br> 
<br>Leave or stay was what they had to say- 
<br>Leave or stay was what it had to say 
<br>But always remember there is a next day, 
<br>Also love is not done in hay. 
<br> 
<br>He went to a crowdy town- 
<br>Busy street,trembling crown. 
<br>She was still on a sigh- 
<br>With the brown spirits raised high. 
<br> 
<br>Sift came up,in the ending round, 
<br>He had his goggles abound. 
<br>She on the outskirts of flirt 
<br>Just managed to escape dust. 
<br> 
<br>Unlike,what you saw all the day! 
<br>End of the sunset came with a ray. 
<br> 
<br>Concluding part came-up with the last say, 
<br>"Love me or I shall move to the bay." 
<br>Love,thus,was for forever found, 
<br>Live together was 'The Last Sound'.

<h4>I will wait for you and you better forget me not</h4>
